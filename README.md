<h5>Data description:</h5> 
I got the data from website:https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics
to get a period year from 1989 to 1999 and combine with another website: https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/migration-data-hub 
to get another period from 1999 to 2017. In this data, I just have data point by year collection so it cannot go into detail
like another data set.

The data is set into 28 rows <i>(by year)</i> and 196 columns <i>(by countries)</i>.

<h5>Emphasis</h5>
In the data, when I need to focus on one data point, country, I can hover and
see how different between a single year and average immigration.
Through the average country line, I can also predict 
for the future immigration for each country. 
By this way, we can guess details for each month 
of the country with a minimum deviation.

In the picture above, I can check data points in May or June in 2015 in which I don't have that in data set, 
but I can evaluate through the paths.  

Additional, the visualization lets me compare 2 different countries in a separated chart with a real data. I also predict a data between 
2 years in a countries by determining a point on a path.

<h5>Closer scope</h5>
In one of data I see, for example, Bhutan was allowed to immigrate from 2010 and reach
the top in 2012 with 10 thousand people, then decreased the same amount each year after that.
I predict that it will go closer to the average line and keep staying there for future years.
